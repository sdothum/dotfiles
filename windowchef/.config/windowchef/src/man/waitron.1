.SH "QUERYING"
Information about the current state of windowchef is available through X properties of the root window\. Example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

xprop \-root WINDOWCHEF_ACTIVE_GROUPS
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Information about the current state of each managed window is available through X properties of the window\. Example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

xprop \-id 0x02c00009 WINDOWCHEF_STATUS
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Here is a list of exposed properties:
.
.TP
\fBWINDOWCHEF_ACTIVE_GROUPS\fR
On the root window\. An integer list of currently active groups\.
.
.TP
\fBWINDOWCHEF_STATUS\fR
On each managed window\. Contains information about the window\. Notable properties: \fBgroup\fR is \-1 if the window is not in a group\. \fBstate\fR can have one of the following values: \fBnormal\fR, \fBmaxed\fR, \fBvmaxed\fR, \fBhmaxed\fR, \fBmonocled\fR\.
.
.SH "CONFIGURING"
Configuring is done using the \fBwm_config\fR command\. Possible configuration keys are:
.
.TP
\fBborder_width\fR \fIwidth\fR
Sets the border width to \fIwidth\fR pixels\.
.
.TP
\fBcolor_focused\fR, \fBcolor_unfocused\fR \fIcolor\fR
Sets the border color to \fIcolor\fR for the focused and unfocused state respectively\. \fIcolor\fR is a hexadecimal value that may or may not start with \fB0x\fR prefix\. Example: \fB0x1234ef\fR\.
.
.TP

.
.TP
\fBinternal_color_focused\fR, \fBinternal_color_unfocused\fR \fIcolor\fR
Like \fBcolor_focused\fR and \fBcolor_unfocused\fR, but for the internal border\.
.
.TP

.TP
\fBgroups_nr\fR \fInr\fR
Sets the number of groups to \fInr\fR\. If \fInr\fR is less than the current number of groups, window that belong to groups whose numbers are greater than \fInr\fR will be mapped to screen and assigned to the null group\.
.
.TP
\fBenable_resize_hints\fR \fIBOOL\fR
If true, \fBwindowchef\fR will respect window resize hints as defined by ICCCM\. Most terminal emulators should have this feature\.
.

Enable sloppy focus\.
.
.TP
\fBsticky_windows\fR \fIBOOL\fR

.
.TP
\fBenable_borders\fR \fIBOOL\fR
If true, the border will be fully managed by the window manager\. Border colors will be set each time a window gets/loses focus\. Setting it to false lets the user manage the border of every window using external tools\. (example: \fBchwb2\fR from wmutils)\.
.
.TP
\fBenable_last_window_focusing\fR \fIBOOL\fR
If true, when the currently focused window is unmapped or closed, \fBwindowchef\fR will focus the previously focused window\. See the \fBwindow_focus_last\fR command\.

.
.TP
\fBreplay_click_on_focus\fR \fIBOOL\fR
